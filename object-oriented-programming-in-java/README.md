1. Trace the execution of code using memory-models.
1. Define the scope of variables and methods.
1. Extend existing libraries to build a medium-sized project.
1. Implement user interface features.
1. Build and work with a class hierarchy that has multiple levels.
1. Explain “is-a” and “has-a” relationships between objects.
1. Author code which implements an Interface.
1. Explain the difference between compile-time and run-time decisions when working with polymorphism.
1. Explain the difference between event-driven programming and imperative programming.
1. Use searching and sorting to design algorithms for analyzing data.
1. Search for an element in a sorted and unsorted list and explain the differences.
1. Explain multiple sorting techniques and performance tradeoffs.
