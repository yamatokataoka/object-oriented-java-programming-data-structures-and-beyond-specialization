# Data Structures and Performance
[This ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance?specialization=java-object-oriented) is a course offered by University of California San Diego on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and the second course of the [Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented?).

# What I learned from this course
1. Describe the difference between an abstract data type (ADT) and its implementation.
1. Work with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: String, LinkedList, TreeSet, HashSet, and HashMap.
1. Implement fundamental data structures from scratch including Linked Lists and Tries.
1. Analyze the performance of code, using Big-O notation as well as through benchmarking experiments.
1. Compare and contrast the performance of different data structures to select the most appropriate for a task.
1. Write JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
1. Implement several algorithms for generating and processing text.
